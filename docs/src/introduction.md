# Introduction

**Firm** is a text-based work management system for technologists. It provides a unified view of your business by representing everything as plain text files you own and control.

## Why Firm?

Modern businesses are natively digital, but lack a unified view. Your data is scattered across SaaS tools you don't control, so you piece together answers by jumping between platforms.

Think of your business as a graph: organizations link to people, people link to projects, projects link to tasks, and so on. Firm lets you define these relationships in plain text files.

Version controlled, locally stored and structured as code with the Firm DSL. This structured representation of your work, *business-as-code*, makes your business accessible to yourself and to the robots that help you run it.

## Features

- **Everything in one place:** Organizations, contacts, projects, and their relationships.
- **Own your data:** Plain text files and tooling that works on your machine.
- **Open data model:** Tailor to your business with custom schemas.
- **Automate anything:** Search, report, integrate, whatever. It's just code.
- **AI-ready:** Bots can easily read, write, and query your business structure.

## Who is it for?

I built Firm to help me run [42futures](https://42futures.com): a solo venture specializing in software pilots.

The tool is suitable for:
- **Freelancers** managing multiple clients and projects
- **Technical teams** who prefer plain text and version control over SaaS dashboards
- **Anyone** who wants to own their data and tools, not rent them from someone else
