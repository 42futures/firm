# Firm Workspace AI Guide

This workspace uses [Firm](https://github.com/42futures/firm), a text-based work management system for defining business entities and their relationships as code.

## How to interact with this workspace

**Prefer using the `firm` CLI for querying data.** The CLI provides validated, structured access to the workspace. You can edit `.firm` files directly when needed, but always run `firm build` afterward to validate your changes.

### Quick Overview Commands

Start with these commands to understand the workspace:

```bash
# See what entity types are available
firm list schema

# List all entities of a specific type
firm list <entity_type>

# Get details for a specific entity
firm get <entity_type> <entity_id>

# Explore relationships for an entity
firm related <entity_type> <entity_id>
```

### Common Workflows

#### Adding a new contact and interaction

When adding contacts, create a `.firm` file with the contact, their organization, and any interactions:

```firm
organization acme {
    name = "Acme Corp"
}

person john_doe {
    name = "John Doe"
}

contact john_at_acme {
    person_ref = person.john_doe
    account_ref = account.acme
    role = "CEO"
}

interaction intro_call {
    type = "Call"
    subject = "Introduction call"
    interaction_date = 2025-12-30 at 14:00 UTC
    initiator_ref = person.me
    primary_contact_ref = contact.john_at_acme
}
```

#### Creating a task

Tasks can reference other entities as their source:

```firm
task follow_up {
    name = "Follow up with John"
    source_ref = interaction.intro_call
    assignee_ref = person.me
    due_date = 2026-01-05
    is_completed = false
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Prefer the CLI for queries**: Use `firm get`, `firm list`, and `firm related` rather than parsing `.firm` files manually
2. **Validate after changes**: Always run `firm build` after editing `.firm` files to ensure your changes are valid
3. **Check schemas first**: Use `firm list schema` to see available entity types and their required fields
4. **Explore relationships**: Use `firm related` to understand connections between entities
5. **Use JSON output for automation**: Add `--format json` to any command for structured output

### CLI Reference

#### `firm build`
Validate the workspace and build the entity graph.

#### `firm get <entity_type> <entity_id>`
Get details for a specific entity.

Example: `firm get contact john_at_acme`

#### `firm list <entity_type>`
List all entities of a type. Use `firm list schema` to see available schemas.

Example: `firm list task`

#### `firm related <entity_type> <entity_id>`
Show all entities related to the specified entity.

Example: `firm related contact john_at_acme`

#### `firm add`
Interactively add a new entity. Note: This command is interactive and not well-suited for automation. Prefer editing `.firm` files directly.

### Output Formats

Use `--format json` for structured output that's easy to parse:

```bash
firm list task --format json | jq '.[] | select(.is_completed == false)'
```

### Notes for AI Agents

- The workspace structure is validated by schemas defined in the `schemas/` directory
- Entity IDs must be unique and follow snake_case naming
- References between entities create a queryable graph structure
- Always validate changes with `firm build` before committing
